                                    Lake Elementaita is derived from the Maasai word <em>muteita</em>, meaning "dust place", a reference to the dryness and dustiness of the area, especially between January and March. The town of Gilgil is near the lake. In the south-to-north sequence of Rift Valley lakes,<strong> Lake</strong><strong>Elmenteita</strong> is between <strong>Lake Naivasha</strong> and <strong>Lake Nakuru</strong>. The major Nairobi-Nakuru highway runs along the nearby escarpment affording motorists a spectacular vista towards the lake. Today the Lake Elementaita is a protected area due to its bird life, and has been named as an UNESCO heritage site together with <strong>Lake Nakuru</strong> and <strong>Lake Bogoria</strong>. At the southern end of the lake are the "Kekopey" hot springs, in which an introduced fish, the <strong>Lake Magadi</strong> tilapia, breed. The reed beds nearby are fishing grounds for night herons and pelicans. The Salt Lake is known for its rich avifauna, among other huge concentrations of Greater and Lesser flamingos, When the seasons become drier, the salt concentration in the alkaline lake becomes higher and the lake will continue changing colour from clear to light-pink and finally to pink-red. Much of your <strong>activity-enriched trip to Kenya’s Lake Elementaita</strong> takes place within the 48,000-acre conservancy that serves as a sanctuary for nationally threatened colobus monkeys, endangered Rothschild giraffes, elusive predators, plains game, avi-fauna and many other species. The varied terrain offers volcanic hills, acacia woodlands, grassy plains and stands of Warburgia fever trees and Euphorbia candelabra. Many species of plains game are commonly sighted, and you may have a fortuitous experience of sighting steinboks, duikers, bush pigs, bushbucks and also other elusive fauna. Lake Elementaita is also home to the tufted-eared caracal, golden and striped jackals and other smaller predators.

The event is usually at its peak when the sun is setting as you enjoy your drink and watch the sun slowly disappear as you sip your drink. It is an awes Inspiring experience you will not forget in a long time. If you`re booked at <strong>Zeituni Lodge</strong>, they have a nice setting Terrance at the edge of the Lake where it can fit well for a sundowner.

                        <h3><strong>Camping in Lake Elementaita.</strong></h3>
                        <p>How about camping at the shores of this magnificent Soda Lake? Sounds like an incredible plan eeh? Yes, it is an experience any adventurer would like to experience.

                        <h3><strong>Lake Elementaita Hot Springs.</strong></h3>
                        <p>It is generally shallow and unexplored, I felt like it is neglected to some extent but it is a good bucket list to tick from your list since it is nearby and easily accessible without any entry fees. It is part of the lake. You will find the Hot Springs at the shores and unless you know where it is located you can get a guide in one of your hotels and request to be guided. The <strong>Lake Elementaita</strong> is not only refreshing but also therapeutic and worth your time. Go and soak in for all the time you want.</p>
                        <h3>Soysambu Conservancy</h3>
                        <p>Lake Elementaita is inside <strong>Soysambu Conservancy</strong> but to get to the main gate, the main entrance is a few Kilometers from the Lake. Soysambu is incredibly engrossing and riveting to say the list. It will give you a different experience compared to other parks. The only challenge is to lack to spot animals as much but I found the experience with the few you will spot unparalleled. According to Soysambu Conservancy, there are few Lions (Though I was not lucky to spot one), buffalo, leopard, hippo, hyena, jackal, eland, zebra, impala, Thompson’s and Grant’s Gazelle, waterbuck, reedbuck, warthog, steenbok, klipspringer, colobus monkey, vervet monkey and a lot of baboons.</p>
